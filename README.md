Key Components:

	1.	Models:
	•	AppetizerResponse: Represents the response model containing a list of Appetizer objects.
	•	Appetizer: A model representing an appetizer with properties like carbs, calories, imageURL, id, description, name, protein, and price.
	•	User: A model representing a user with attributes such as firstName, lastName, email, birthdate, extraNapkins, and frequentRefills.
	•	MockData: Contains sample data for testing and development purposes.
 
	2.	ViewModels:
	•	AppetizerListViewModel: Manages the state and logic for fetching and displaying appetizers in the AppetizerListView. It uses @Published properties to bind data to the view and handle state changes.
 
	3.	Networking:
	•	NetworkManager: A singleton class responsible for making API calls. It handles fetching appetizer data and downloading images, using URLSession for networking. It includes error handling with custom AppetizerError cases.
 
	4.	UI Components:
	•	AppetizerListCell: A SwiftUI view that displays a single appetizer in a list, using AsyncImage to load images from URLs.
	•	AppetizerTabView: A tab view containing three tabs: Home, Account, and Order.
	•	LoadingView: A view that displays a loading spinner while data is being fetched.
	•	EmptyState: A view used to display a message when there’s no data to show.
	•	XDismissButton: A simple button to dismiss views, represented by an “X” icon.
	•	AppetizerButton: A custom button used throughout the app.
 
	5.	Error Handling:
	•	AppetizerError: An enum defining various errors that can occur during network operations.
	•	AlertItem and AlertContext: Used to manage and display alerts for different error scenarios.
 
	6.	Extensions:
	•	Color+Ext: Adds custom color support for the app’s theme.
	•	String+Ext: Adds email validation using Regex for iOS 16 or newer.

Functionality:

	•	The app fetches appetizer data from a remote server using NetworkManager, displays it in a list using AppetizerListView, and handles user interactions, such as adding items to an order.
	•	Error handling is robust, with clear alerts provided for various failure scenarios.
	•	The app uses SwiftUI’s declarative syntax to build the UI and leverages @StateObject and @Published properties for state management.
